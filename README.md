closed-captioning
=================

closed-captioning is a tweet + IRC aggregator, intended for conference talks. this is inspired by [ruby-no-kai/kaigi_subscreen](https://github.com/ruby-no-kai/kaigi_subscreen).

hashtag is a fun way of getting audience feedback, but it's not meant to be reliable or responsive, partially due to twitter's hourly API limits.ã€€IRC on the other hand, while not as accessible as twitter, is more reliable and responsive.

how to setup closed-captioning
------------------------------

### sbt-twt

run sbt:

    > twt log
    accept the authorization request in your browser, for the fun to begin.
    (brower should pop up asking if you want to let sbt-twt access you account)
    then run `twt pin <pin>` to complete the process.
    > twt pin 8686743

this creates a configuration to grab tweets as you.

### application.config

under `conf` directory create a file named `application.conf`:

```
closed-captioning {
  websocket {
    port = 5679
  }

  irc {
    nickname = "your_bot_name"
    username = "your_bot_name"
    hostname = "irc.freenode.net"
    port = 6667
    encoding = "UTF-8"
    channel = "##your_channel"
  }

  twitter {
    search-query = "#scala"
    count = 5
    interval = 60s
  }
}
```

the nickname and the username cannot be your own nickname.

### irc

using your favorite IRC client, join the specified channel as yourself.

### starting websocket server

run `re-start` from sbt shell to start the websocket server in the background:

    > re-start
    [info] Application not yet started
    [info] Starting application in the background ...
    app: Starting com.eed3si9n.cc.App.main()
    app: [2013-02-18 06:44:00] Contacting myJRebel server ..
    ....
    app: ready!

this might take a little time. once the server is up, you should see your bot joining the IRC channel.

### JavaScript client

open http://eed3si9n.com/closed-captioning/ using Chrome.
if it says "connection open," then we are in business.
start typing something into the IRC channel.
